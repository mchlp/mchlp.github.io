Hi! My name is Michael and I'll be attending the University of Waterloo next year for Software Engineering. I've been to a few hackathons and participated a number of competitive programming competitions.

I started programming in grade nine using Python before taking interest in competitive programming. From then on, I've worked with numerous programming languages and frameworks.

Currently, I've been focusing on web developement using React and machine learning using TensorFlow.
